Athens trivia
=============

Si fueris Romae, Romano vivito more, si fueris alibi, vivito sicut ibi.


Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning around 3,400 years, and the earliest human presence started somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC.

Athens became the first Cultural Capital of Europe in 1985.

Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 7000 years.

Athens is home to 148 theatrical stages, more than any other city in the world, including the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus, home to the Athens Festival, which runs from May to October each year.

An etiological myth explaining how Athens has acquired this name was well known among ancient Athenians. The goddess of wisdom, Athena and the god of the seas, Poseidon had many disagreements and battles between them, and one of these was a race to be the Patron God of the city. In an attempt to compel the people, Poseidon created a salt water spring by striking the ground with his trident, symbolizing naval power. However, when Athena created the olive tree, symbolizing peace and prosperity, the Athenians, under their ruler Cecrops, accepted the olive tree and named the city after Athena.

A large part of the town’s historic centre has been converted into a 3-kilometre pedestrian zone (the largest in Europe), leading to the major archaeological sites (“archaeological park”), reconstructing – to a large degree – the ancient landscape.

Athens is named after Athena, the goddess of wisdom, who defeated Poseidon to become the patroness of the city. Moreover Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece
